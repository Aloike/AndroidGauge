The "Gradle Projects window" is a tab on the right side of Android Studio.

Careful with the task names !

### Step 9: Upload Files Using the Bintray Plugin
Open the Gradle Projects window again and search for the bintrayUpload task (under Tasks > publishing). Double-click it to begin uploading the files.
